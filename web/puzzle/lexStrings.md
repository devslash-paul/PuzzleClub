# Puzzle Club Week something or other

Your task is to Lexicographically sort two strings. 

You are given two Strings, called `one` and `two`. Your function must return a String 
`result.size() == one.size() + two.size()`. 

To sort the strings you can only take a single letter from the front of a String at each time. So lets have an example:

```
one = "zba";
two = "daz";
```

A correct result should be `zdbaza`. Letters are taken from one, two, one, two, two, then one. 

Your program must implement the interface below *with absolutely no modifications*

To 'solve' this you'll need to pass every test, and be the fastest in the leader board! If you're really close, do consider
that my computer is slow, you can absolutely submit again.
